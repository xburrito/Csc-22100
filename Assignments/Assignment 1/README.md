# Assignment 1

Create two classes: Painting and TestPainting

## Within Class Painting:
- Initiate 4 private variables:
  - artistName (type string)
  - name (type string)
  - price (type double)
  - year (type int)

- Create a default constructor initializing double/int variables to zero and Strings to "-"

- Create a non-default constructor with three parameters to assign values to artistName, name, price, and year variable

- Create Setters and Getters for each of the private variables

- Create a public method of type double called getMinimumDiscountPrice that returns a value 10% of price

- Create a public method of type double called getMaximumDiscountPrice that returns a value 15% of price

- Create a public method of type int called getAge that returns the age of the painting given our current year

HINT: Instead of manually inputting our current year, obtain it through the library: java.util.Calendar

## Within Class TestPainting (Main Function for testing Class Painting)
 
 - Import java.util.Scanner to allow user input
 
 - Call the default constructor
 
 - Test the Setters from Class Painting
 
 - Using the Scanner Class, ask user to set the values for each of the variables created in Class Painting
 
 - Use the non-default constructor and test custom parameters.
 
 - Use the printf format to output the results of all the inputs and test if code is working 100%
